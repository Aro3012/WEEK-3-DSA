## Overview

This week introduced you to writing more resilient and user-friendly programs. You learned how to handle runtime errors using exceptions, throw your own custom errors, and manage files for reading and writing data using core Java I/O classes.

- Why exception handling is important

### Day 2: Types of Exceptions & Try-Catch Blocks

- Common exceptions: `ArithmeticException`, `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`, `NullPointerException`, etc.
- Writing `try-catch` blocks
- Multiple catch blocks
- finally block

### Day 3: Throw, Throws & Custom Exceptions

- Using `throw` to raise an exception
- Declaring exceptions using `throws`
- Creating custom exceptions using user-defined classes
- Use cases for custom exceptions

### Day 4: File Handling Basics

- Creating, deleting, and checking properties of files

### Day 5: FileReader, FileWriter, BufferedReader

- Reading from files using `FileReader` and `BufferedReader`
- Writing to files using `FileWriter`
- Understanding buffering and performance impact
- Handling I/O exceptions

### Day 6: Scanner Class & Try-With-Resources

- Reading user input from console and files using `Scanner`
- Using `try-with-resources` to manage file streams
- Best practices for file handling and resource management
